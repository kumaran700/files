                    Rotary Club of Madras Chenna Patna’s <strong>Global Grant Project Mellinam</strong> is hitting new milestones every month. It is on the verge of screening 5,000 women. It was inaugurated by the <strong>Health Minister Geetha Jeevan.</strong> <br><br>
                    Mellinam is the maiden global grant project of RCMCP that is aimed to <strong>create awareness and for early detection of breast cancer among women.</strong> The club has initiated a three-way tie-up — four College of Nursing for screening, Rotary Clubs for funds and a NGO for further treatment. <br><br>
                    Tamil Nadu Nursing Council Registrar <strong>Dr. Rtn. S. Ani Grace</strong>, as <strong>project chairman</strong>, was instrumental in bringing four Colleges of Nursing to the discussion table and to take the project forward. <br><br>
                    The pilot project was rolled out at four Public Health Centres in the City during the first week of February that saw distribution of pamphlets, creating awareness through traditional songs and getting feedback from customers. As per the plan, it is proposed to <strong>screen 14,000 women over a period of 12 months</strong>. <br><br>
                    RCMCP is the lead club for this <strong>₹37.50 lakh Global Grant project. Rotary Club of Catarqui, Canada</strong> is the international partner, while <strong>Rotary Club of Madras North East</strong> local partner. The breast screening was done with a help of a handheld device called ibreast, specially procured from the U.S-based <strong>UE LifeSciences</strong>. The US based firm also imparted training. <br><br>
                    The representatives of <strong>M.A. Chidambaram College of Nursing</strong>, <strong>Madha College of Nursing</strong>, <strong>Shree Balaji College of Nursing</strong> and <strong>Omayal Achi College of Nursing</strong> took part in the roll out function, which was also attended by key office bearers of RCMCP.
