            Passion for service has brought me to Rotary, and I strongly believe that Service to Humanity and consciouness about Environment are the binding forces in Rotary. This Imagine Year, aptly lead by a lady RI President, we would be strengthening our focus on projects that bolsters women health, wellbeing and empowerment.  <br><br>
            Over the last few years we have already made Women centered projects a priority. We launched "Mellinam" last year for early detection and possible prevention of Breast Cancer
among underpriviledged women.  We are also providing scholarships to girl children through our OPERATION DAY BREAK Project. Our Club this
year plans to also launch ‘KALKI’, ‘SHE COMPLAINT BOX’ Project, by working as a Lead Club in partnership with other district clubs. <br><br>
Looking forward to a great year under the guidance and support of my club members and other like minded International Rotary partners.
